    <p>How to make a Pastel de papas.</p>
    <p>This is a typical argentinian recipe. We often eat this in family reunions (during winter).</p>
    <p>First, we are going to need:
        <ul>
            <li>Grinded beef</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Potatoes</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Paprika</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <ol>Step by step:
        <li>Boil the potatoes, and in the meanwhile cut the onions and the paprika into small pieces and cook it with the meat. We also need to boil the eggs.</li>
        <li>After everything is cooked, smash the potatoes, add some milk and butter and stir it.</li>
        <li>Then, grab a recipient, put one lay of puree, then the meat, and more puree on top. Pre-heat the oven at 220Â°C and introduce the Pastel de papas into the oven for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>After this, take it out of the oven and serve it. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
